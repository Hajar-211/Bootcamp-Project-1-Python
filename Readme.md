### By Hajar Alamer
*This is a Python script that checks the strength of a password and provides feedback on any requirements that the password does not meet. It also calculates the hash of the password using SHA256 Algorithm.*

## Prerequisites

To use this script, you'll need to have Python 3 installed on your machine.


## Password Strength Checker Main Function

The password strength checker has the following main features:

1. *Common Password Detection:* The checker checks if the user's password matches any of the common passwords that are considered weak.

2. *Length Check:* The checker assesses the length of the password and provides a strength level based on its length.

3. *Minimum Requirements Check:* The checker checks whether the password meets certain minimum requirements, such as having at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, one special character, and being at least 6 characters long.

4. *SHA256 Hash Calculation:* The checker calculates the SHA256 hash of the password for secure storage and verification.

These features work together to provide a basic but effective password strength checker that can help users create strong passwords that meet common security requirements
